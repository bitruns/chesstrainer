# chesstrainer
A trainer that suggests positive chess moves and marks bad moves. Captures board via user defined regions and utilizes a tensorflow chess board extractor alongside pyautogui.

-Because of the scripts use of tensorflow, a set of piece models is required but the file size is too large for github

-Download the saved_models folder from this google drive link:

(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14a0H6WMXwAZsZoeBkCAZC-C-mt940wsW?usp=sharing)

Place the file saved_models into the chess trainer directory and the script is ready to run.
